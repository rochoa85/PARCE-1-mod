## Changes

In this version of PARCE, new functionalities have been added to manipulate drug-peptide systems. As example, a drug bound to a cyclic peptide in water is available to run the protocol. **In this scenario, only Scwrl4 is able to generate the mutations.**

Additionally, a new option to run single scoring with Metropolis Monte Carlo is available using any of the scoring functions. Finally, for the drug-peptide system, a total of six new scoring functions have been included, so the user has the option to run Metropolis or run consensus scoring with the selected functions. A test is also included to check the tools in the context of the drug-peptide system.
